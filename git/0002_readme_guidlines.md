## Title: Standardization of README Structure for New Projects

### Status: Accepted

### Context

Clear and consistent documentation is essential for the effective collaboration, maintenance, and onboarding of team members in any software project. Historically, inconsistencies in README files have led to confusion, miscommunication, and increased time spent understanding project setups and functionalities. To mitigate these issues, there is a need to establish a standardized README structure that all new projects will adhere to.

### Decision

All new projects will include a README file that follows the specified 12-section structure:

1. **Introduction**

   - Purpose of the document
   - Target audience and their level of technical expertise
   - Overview of the code and its significance

2. **Installation and Setup**

   - System requirements
   - Prerequisites and dependencies
   - Step-by-step installation instructions
   - Configuration options

3. **Getting Started**

   - High-level architecture overview
   - Main features and functionalities
   - Basic usage examples
   - Important concepts and terminology

4. **Code Structure**

   - Overview of the directory/file structure
   - Description of each major component/module
   - Interdependencies between different parts of the code

5. **API Documentation (if necessary)**

   - Overview of the available APIs
   - Detailed explanation of input parameters and expected outputs
   - Sample API requests and responses

6. **Configuration and Customisation (if necessary)**

   - Explanation of configuration files or settings
   - How to customize the code for specific use cases
   - Best practices and recommended configurations

7. **Troubleshooting and FAQs (if necessary)**

   - Common issues and their solutions
   - Error messages and their meanings
   - Frequently asked questions and their answers

8. **Performance Optimization (if necessary)**

   - Techniques for improving code performance
   - Best practices for resource management
   - Profiling and benchmarking recommendations

9. **Security Considerations (if necessary)**

   - Potential security vulnerabilities and their mitigation
   - Secure coding practices
   - Authentication and authorization guidelines

10. **Limitations and Future Enhancements (if necessary)**

    - Known limitations of the code
    - Possible areas for improvement
    - Roadmap for future updates and enhancements

11. **References (if necessary)**

    - List of external resources used in the document
    - Citations for relevant papers, articles, or libraries

12. **Appendix (if necessary)**
    - Sample code snippets or templates
    - Glossary of terms
    - Additional resources or tutorials

### Consequences

**Benefits:**

- **Consistency:** Ensures all team members and external collaborators can easily navigate and understand new projects.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces time spent on onboarding and decreases the learning curve for new contributors.
- **Professionalism:** Presents a polished and standardized image to external stakeholders and open-source communities.
- **Maintenance:** Simplifies future updates and maintenance by having a clear documentation structure.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Initial Effort:** Requires additional time during the project setup phase to complete all sections of the README.
- **Overhead for Small Projects:** Might be cumbersome for simple scripts or small projects where some sections are not applicable.

### Rationale

Implementing a standardized README structure addresses the common challenges associated with inconsistent documentation. By outlining clear expectations for documentation, we facilitate better communication within the team and with any external parties involved. This structure is comprehensive yet flexible, allowing for sections to be marked as "if necessary," ensuring relevance to projects of varying sizes and complexities.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Minimalist README:** Using a simplified README with only basic information. Rejected due to insufficient detail for complex projects.
- **Automated Documentation Tools:** Utilizing tools that generate documentation from code comments. While useful, they do not replace the need for a well-structured README that provides high-level insights and instructions.

### Related Decisions

- **ADR on Preferred Toolset Adoption:** Aligns with the decision to standardize tools and practices across projects for consistency and efficiency.
